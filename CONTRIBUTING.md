# Contributing

## Before you contribute

### File an issue first!

If you see a bug or have an idea for a feature that you feel would improve the repo, **please
[file an issue](https://github.com/arteevraina/knowyourdonor/issues/new) before you begin
coding or send a PR**. This will help prevent duplicate work by letting us know
what you're up to. It will help avoid a situation in which you spend a lot of
time coding something that's not quite right for the repo or its goals.
